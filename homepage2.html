      <h2>About Germany</h2>
    <p>Germany will be my second destination. I have always dreamed of visiting this country for various reasons. Since a very young age, the German language has always caught my attention. I have taken a couple German classes and now when I finally go I will be able to put my skills to the test. I also plan on practicing more German and hopefully learning new things I didn't know before. There are over 2,000 castles in Germany and I would love to go abroad and see as many castles as I possibly can. The first castle I plan on exploring is the Heidelberg Castle. This castle  dominates the view of the old center of Heidelberg and has had a long and rough history since the earliest castle structure was built. Heidelberg was completely destroyed during the Thirty Years War and later by the French in the 17th century. I truly find the histories of castles to be extremely interesting and I can't wait to see not only this castle but many other castles in Germany.</p>
