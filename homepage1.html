    <h2>About Italy</h2>
    <p>Although I visited Italy back when I was 12 years old, I plan on this being my first destination once I graduate college and begin my travel adventures. One of the reasons is due to the fact that Italy has more masterpieces per square mile than any other country and it's the fifth most visited country in the world, welcoming over 45 million visitors annually! The second reason being that unsurprisingly, Italy is the world's largest exporter of wine- and hey, who doesn't like wine. Italy surrounds two of the worldâ€™s smallest countries. These are San Marino in Northern Italy, which is also the oldest republic in the world and Vatican City in Rome, the smallest country in the world. Did you know that the colors of the Italian flag have a special meaning? Green represents hope, white represents faith, and red represents charity.</p>
